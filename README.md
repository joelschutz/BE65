# BE65
A experiment with MOS 6502 emulation with Python

## Motivation
This code was originally written in 2021 inspired by the videos of [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater) on the 6502 micro-processor, that's why the name: `Ben Eater 6502 -> BE65`.

## Recommendations
There is a couple ou programs that were used to help development, maybe try then:
- [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/index.php?view=compile) - Simple and effective Assembler for the 6502 family
- [6502 EhBASIC](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_EhBASIC_V2.22) - EhBASIC port for the 6502 family
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - This is necessary to install the project

## Disclaimer
This code was not tested for this upload, it may not work properly.
